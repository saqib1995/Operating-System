# Operating-System

This repository includes implmentation of several UNIX features in the xv6 Operating System. 

## Unix head and tail command 

The head command is used to print the number of lines provided along with the command from the start of the given file. The tail command has the same purpose with the only change of printing from the end of the file.


## Shell Implementation

Implementing 3 basic tasks for a shell to function properly,

### 1. Command Execution 
To ensure that the basic commands such as ls and grep execute.

### 2. I/O Redirection
Using '>' to store output to a file and '<' to get input from a file.

### 3. Pipelining
Ability to pipe the output of one command to be the input of other command.
